## Background Video for Login Screen

Place a video file named `background.mp4` in this directory to be used as the background for the login screen.

### Video Requirements:
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
- **Resolution**: 1080p or 720p recommended
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (will loop automatically)
- **File Size**: Keep under 5MB for optimal loading
- **Content**: Should be subtle and not too distracting
  - Suggested: Abstract patterns, slow-moving backgrounds, or military-themed imagery
  - Avoid: High-contrast or fast-moving content that could make text hard to read

### Example Content Ideas:
- Slow panning shots of flags
- Abstract military-themed patterns
- Subtle gradient animations
- Aerial views in slow motion

### Note:
The current placeholder file should be replaced with an actual video file for production use.
